# SLM-control-with-CMOS-camera-as-monitor

This program offers a real time monit according to different phase mask encoded on SLM with a Hammamtsu CMOS camera.

The brand of SLM is holoeye, so both SDK from Hammamtsu and Holoeye are essential.

The program can encode the phase patterns from arbitary size pictures and cut part of it. It can also encoded basic patterns like lens and gratings. It's flexible for calibrating SLM or do some test. You can add any patterns together in any rectangular part of SLM.
